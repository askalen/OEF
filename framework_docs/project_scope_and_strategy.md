# Modern Data Engineering System: Project Scope and Strategy

## Project Overview
This project introduces an innovative data engineering system that reimagines how organizations bridge the gap between raw data lakes and analytics-ready databases. While drawing inspiration from traditional approaches, the system introduces its own unique architecture, nomenclature, and design patterns specifically crafted for modern data environments. The focus is on transforming raw relational data into clean, organized datasets through a novel framework that prioritizes clarity, ease of use, extensibility, and efficient data flows.

## Technical Foundation

The system is built on a carefully chosen technology stack of Snowflake, dbt Core, and Apache Airflow. However, rather than simply implementing standard patterns, it introduces a new structural approach that better leverages these tools' capabilities. The architecture has been designed from the ground up to optimize data flows and streamline development processes, while establishing its own distinct patterns and terminology that better reflect modern data engineering needs.

## System Components

### Design Framework
The core of the system is a comprehensive set of database design rules that cover most common enterprise use cases. These rules are implemented through a collection of templates and macros that transform development into a more structured, "fill in the blanks" process. This approach significantly reduces development time while ensuring consistency and reliability.

### Development Resources
The system includes a complete template repository containing pre-built dbt and Snowflake models, along with custom Snowflake functions and an extensive dbt macro library. These resources are designed to handle common transformation patterns while remaining flexible enough to accommodate unique business requirements.

### Layer Architecture
The system implements a structured layer architecture:

1. **Raw Layer (RAW)**: Original source data without modification
2. **Source Layer (SRC)**: Standardized raw data with minimal cleaning
3. **Vault Intermediate Layer (VIN)**: Handles source system transitions and combinations when needed
4. **Vault Layer (VLT)**: Normalized storage of business objects and relationships
5. **Analytics Intermediate Layer (AIN)**: Parallel processing for event aggregation and denormalization
6. **Analytics Layer (ANA)**: Complete business objects with analytical measures
7. **Mart Layer (MRT)**: Pre-calculated metrics and purpose-built output tables

Each layer serves a specific function in the data flow, creating a clear separation of concerns while supporting both historical preservation and analytical access through a state-focused approach that treats business object evolution as the primary analytical foundation.

### Implementation Methodology
The deployment process begins with a critical knowledge gathering phase that runs parallel to technical setup. This phase focuses on three key areas:

1. Raw Data Understanding: A systematic approach to documenting and understanding available data sources, their relationships, and quality characteristics.

2. Business Object Planning: Detailed mapping of business concepts to technical implementations, ensuring the final system meets actual business needs.

3. Design Space Documentation: Comprehensive documentation of all possible tables and their relationships based on available data, creating a clear map for future development.

## Personal Development Strategy

The project follows a carefully planned progression:

1. System Design and Development: Creating and refining the complete system, including all templates, macros, and documentation.

2. Testing and Validation: Rigorous testing of all components to ensure reliability and performance.

3. Publication: Making the system available to the broader data engineering community, establishing credibility and expertise.

4. Strategic Career Advancement: Leveraging the published system to secure a lead data engineering position at a company seeking to transform their data systems. The pre-built nature of the system provides an immediate advantage in implementing positive change.

## Implementation Strategy

The system is designed to be deployed as a standalone solution that can initially run parallel to existing processes. This approach allows for careful validation and gradual migration while minimizing risk. The end goal is complete replacement of legacy systems with a more efficient, maintainable solution.

## Business Impact

The system addresses several critical challenges in enterprise data engineering:

Development Efficiency: By providing pre-built solutions for common patterns, the system dramatically reduces development time and ensures consistency.

Maintenance: Clear documentation and standardized patterns make maintenance more straightforward and less dependent on individual tribal knowledge.

Scalability: The design patterns accommodate growth in both data volume and complexity while maintaining performance.

## Future Growth

### Consulting Practice Development
After successful implementation in an enterprise environment, the system provides a foundation for independent consulting work. The proven success of the system in a large-scale deployment creates opportunities for implementing similar transformations at other companies.

### System Evolution
The system will continue to evolve based on real-world implementation experience and changing technology landscapes. Regular updates to templates, macros, and documentation will ensure the system remains current and valuable.

## Success Metrics

Success will be measured through both technical and business metrics:

Technical Success: Improved query performance, reduced development time, and enhanced data quality metrics provide concrete evidence of system effectiveness.

Business Success: Faster time to market for new data products, reduced maintenance overhead, and improved analyst productivity demonstrate business value.

## Risk Management

The system addresses common risks through careful design choices:

Technical Risk: The use of proven, widely-adopted tools minimizes technical risk while providing clear upgrade paths.

Implementation Risk: The parallel deployment strategy allows for careful validation before full cutover.

Business Risk: Clear documentation and standardized patterns reduce dependency on individual team members and make knowledge transfer more efficient.
