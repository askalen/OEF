## Overview

The Object Evolution Framework (OEF) is a comprehensive data engineering system that transforms raw data into analytics-ready information through a state-focused, business-oriented approach. Unlike traditional event-centric architectures, OEF treats business object state evolution as the primary analytical foundation.

## Project Scope

This framework provides:

- **Complete methodology** for state-focused data architecture
- **dbt Core implementation** with custom macros and templates  
- **Snowflake optimization** patterns and custom functions
- **Apache Airflow integration** for orchestration
- **Comprehensive documentation** covering implementation and deployment

## Core Innovation

OEF reimagines data warehousing by:

- Focusing on **business object state progression** rather than discrete events
- Creating **aggregatable dimensions** that maintain full historical context
- Enabling **modular rebuilds** by isolating volatile components
- Providing **consistent structural patterns** across all table types

## Architecture

The framework implements a seven-layer architecture:

1. **RAW** - Original source data
2. **SRC** - Cleaned and structured source tables  
3. **VIN** - Vault Intermediate (when needed for complex transformations)
4. **VLT** - Business Vault (normalized business objects)
5. **AIN** - Analytics Intermediate (parallel event aggregation and denormalization)
6. **ANA** - Analytics Layer (complete business objects)
7. **MRT** - Data Marts (purpose-built consumption tables)

## Key Benefits

- **Rebuild Efficiency**: Change business logic without recalculating expensive aggregations
- **Historical Accuracy**: Complete audit trail of all object state changes
- **Analytical Flexibility**: Objects prepared for any metric aggregation pattern
- **Operational Clarity**: Consistent naming and structure patterns
- **Governance Simplicity**: Clear database and schema separation

## Technology Stack

- **Snowflake**: Cloud data warehouse infrastructure
- **dbt Core**: Data transformation and modeling
- **Apache Airflow**: Workflow orchestration
- **Git**: Version control and deployment

*Note: While optimized for this stack, the methodology can be adapted to other modern data platforms.*
