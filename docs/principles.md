# Principles

The core beliefs and reasoning that drive every design decision in the Object Evolution Framework.

## Absolute Historical Truth

Any system relying on "current" tables risks data misalignment and the inability to reproduce or justify results. Modern analytics demands point-in-time accuracy - understanding what your business looked like at any historical moment, not just what it looks like today.

Even when historical analysis isn't immediately necessary, it probably will be in the future. It's better to capture everything from the beginning than to need historical context and discover it's been lost forever. Questions like "What was our customer risk profile when we made that pricing decision?" or "How did our segmentation logic impact outcomes over time?" become impossible to answer without complete historical tracking.

**Implementation:** Every business object change is captured in SCD Type 2 format with full audit trails, enabling point-in-time snapshots and historical analysis at any level of granularity.

## Object State Over Transaction Events

Traditional data warehouses center around transaction processing because that's what older business systems tracked. Modern companies increasingly need to understand how business objects evolve over time - customer risk profiles, product categorizations, account relationships, user engagement levels.

The shift from "what happened" to "how things changed" requires fundamentally different architectural approaches. Event-centric warehouses can tell you about individual transactions but struggle to answer questions about state evolution, trend analysis, or the contextual environment when decisions were made.

**Implementation:** Business objects are first-class entities with their own historical tracking, relationships, and evolution patterns, rather than being treated as static dimensions that enrich event data.

## Processing Efficiency Over Storage Optimization

Data storage costs continue to plummet while processing costs remain significant. Clean, well-structured tables with efficient transformation layers minimize overall processing costs per batch and reduce the computational overhead of analytical queries.

This principle drives the decision to maintain multiple processed layers rather than computing everything on-demand. Pre-processed, clean tables with proper clustering and indexing strategies provide better performance and cost management than attempts to minimize storage footprint.

**Implementation:** Layered architecture with purpose-built table structures, optimized clustering strategies, and incremental processing patterns that prioritize computation efficiency over storage minimization.

## Single Source of Truth

Every field and calculation is defined in exactly one place, ever. When business logic needs to change, it only requires modification in one location, drastically reducing turnaround time, improving accuracy, and minimizing effort.

Duplicate logic across multiple tables creates maintenance nightmares, data inconsistencies, and exponential debugging complexity. The principle extends beyond just calculations to include business object definitions, field naming conventions, and transformation patterns.

**Implementation:** Hierarchical data flow where each field has one authoritative definition, with downstream tables inheriting rather than redefining business logic. Registry tables establish canonical business object mappings that all other tables reference.

## Proven Patterns Over Custom Solutions

There is transformation code that is tried, tested, and efficient. There's no reason for multiple engineers to write, test, and risk breaking the same logic repeatedly in different ways. Standardized patterns locked behind macros eliminate the possibility of implementation errors and reduce development time.

Most data engineering complexity stems from constantly re-solving already-solved problems. Custom implementations introduce bugs, require individual testing, and create maintenance overhead that proven patterns avoid entirely.

**Implementation:** Comprehensive macro system that automates standard transformation patterns, with templates that generate consistent table structures and processing logic. Custom code is constrained to business-specific logic rather than infrastructure concerns.

## Talent Optimization

Senior engineers shouldn't waste time on repetitive infrastructure code, debugging spaghetti logic, or fixing poorly named fields. The framework should enable junior engineers to build reliably while freeing senior talent to focus on complex business problems that actually require their expertise.

When standard patterns handle routine development tasks, experienced engineers can concentrate on challenging problems like complex business logic, performance optimization, and architectural decisions that truly benefit from their skills.

**Implementation:** Templates and macros handle infrastructure complexity, allowing engineers at all levels to focus on business logic. Clear patterns and conventions reduce the learning curve and enable reliable development across skill levels.

## Deterministic Architecture

The table structure of a data warehouse should be entirely determined by business object design and data relationships. By removing subjectivity from architectural decisions, the framework eliminates duplicate logic, duplicate tables, lost data, misinterpreted fields, and conflicting results.

When everyone knows that specific tables are the absolute source of truth for particular business concepts, all downstream development aligns naturally. Design time decreases, conflicts disappear, and data consistency improves dramatically.

**Implementation:** Prescriptive naming conventions, standardized table types, and systematic layering patterns that create predictable table structures based purely on business object relationships and data flow requirements.

## Minimal Processing Gates

Changes to business logic should only require reprocessing from the affected layer forward, preserving expensive upstream work. When an aggregate metric needs modification, only the final transformation layer should require rebuilding, leaving all earlier processed data intact.

Traditional approaches often require full historical rebuilds when business logic changes, creating massive computational overhead and extended development cycles. Strategic layering creates natural breakpoints that contain the scope of any modification.

**Implementation:** Layered architecture with clear separation of concerns, where each layer serves as a processing gate. Cursor tracking and incremental processing ensure that changes propagate efficiently without unnecessary recomputation of stable upstream data.

## Structural Predictability

You should know the core structure of any table before it exists, enabling parallel development and design work. Standardized patterns mean that table schemas, field ordering, and processing logic follow predictable rules based on the table's purpose and business object relationships.

Predictable structures eliminate design paralysis, reduce merge conflicts, and enable teams to work simultaneously on related components without coordination overhead. Each model becomes a focused, single-purpose file that fits into a broader systematic framework.

**Implementation:** Standardized table types with defined field ordering, naming conventions, and processing patterns. Template-driven development where table structure flows naturally from business object design and architectural position.

## Constraint-Driven Simplicity

Proper design constraints eliminate most unnecessary work that typically consumes data engineering effort. When architectural patterns handle standard scenarios systematically, custom solutions become the rare exception rather than the default approach.

The majority of data warehouse complexity comes from attempting to solve unique problems that are actually common scenarios in disguise. Recognizing and constraining these patterns reduces both development effort and ongoing maintenance burden.

**Implementation:** Framework patterns that handle standard use cases comprehensively, with escape hatches for genuine edge cases. Clear guidelines for when custom solutions are appropriate, with most development following established templates and macro-generated logic.
